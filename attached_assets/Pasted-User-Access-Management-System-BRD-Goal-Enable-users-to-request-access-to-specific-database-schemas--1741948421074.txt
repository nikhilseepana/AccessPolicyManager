Goal:
Enable users to request access to specific database schemas, tables, and fields, and allow admins to approve or reject these requests. Admins can also upload the latest database schema metadata.

Key Features:

Users request access to schemas, tables, and fields.
Users can specify AllowAll, Allow, or Deny access for fields.
Users can request access to multiple schemas/tables/fields.
Admin Portal:

Admins approve or reject user requests.
Admins can apply access policies (AllowAll, Allow, Deny) to specific fields.
Admins can upload the latest data dictionary (database schema metadata).
Admins can view and manage all user requests.
Roles:

User Role: Requests access to resources but cannot approve or modify others' requests.
Admin Role: Approves/rejects access requests, manages policies, and uploads data dictionary.
Copy User Access:

Admin can copy permissions from one user to another (pending approval).
Conflict Management:

No conflicting permissions (e.g., AllowAll vs. Deny) on the same table/field.
Notifications:

Users are notified of the approval or rejection of their access requests.
